        All our products are grown with natural farming practices. There is no use of chemicals or heavy
        machinery which can give similar/standard results. This means two batches can vary in size, taste, etc.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our promise to you is that we are enthusiastic about our farming practice, which is simple, traditional,
        and natural. Our network partners are inspired by SPNF, SPK, or Natural farming practices. Only Desi Cow
        dung and cow urine are used in our farming. No chemical by whatever name is used and so you get pure
        natural health products.

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>
          We recommend you try small size packets first so that you understand if you like the product. Once you
          are happy, then start bulk buying. This shall reduce your chances of returns/refunds drastically and
          give you a better consumer experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have doubts about any products, read the information given on our website{' '}
          <a href="https://www.Sarkhotnaturalfarms.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-green-600 hover:underline">www.Sarkhotnaturalfarms.com</a>.
          We have used actual photos of products at most places with a humble belief that our product images
          along with the content will help you in your buying journey. If still, you have questions, kindly
          reach us on WhatsApp / call – <a href="tel:9920999100" className="text-green-600 hover:underline">9920999100</a> or email us at{' '}

        <li>
          We have curated our Refund & Returns policy (given below) so that genuine cases of damage/defect are
          promptly resolved.
        </li>
        <li>Refund/return request is eligible only in cases where the items are defective/damaged OR are missing.</li>
        <li>
          Good faith is a key to being eligible for a refund/replacement. If we come across bad intentions/bad
          faith or any such setting which tries to take advantage of this policy, we have every right to deny
          any replacement/refund.
        </li>
        <li>
          In cases, where a consumer has purchased something by mistake, returns/refund request is denied as a
          fair amount of cost has already been incurred in packaging, Quality control, billing & delivery.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Timeline for raising refund/return request:</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Dry items such as Grocery, Wood Pressed OR Cold pressed oils, A2 Desi ghee & butter: Within 10 days
          from the delivery date.
        </li>
        <li>Fresh Fruits & Vegetables: Within 1 day from the delivery date.</li>
        <li>
          Fresh Fruits (Delivered in raw form): In the case of Fruits, where the items were delivered in their
          raw stage, the replacement/refund timeline starts when the fruits start to ripen. However, as these
          items are at the consumers’ place, storage care must be taken by the consumer.
        </li>
        <li>
          For Items with specific replacement/refund timelines: Specific timelines will precede the general
          timelines. For Mangoes, if it is mentioned that 2 in every 12 mangoes are assumed to get spoilt and
          replacement/refund is eligible for 3 mangoes and above. Then this special replacement/refund policy
          for mangoes precedes our general replacement policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Missing product: If in a package, one or more items are missing, then notify us within 3 days from
          the delivery date. Here return/replacement will be applicable only for missing items (Not for the
          whole package).
        </li>
        <li>
          If a consumer reaches out to us within the given timelines, we shall replace/process their refund
          after our due diligence.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Situations where no refund/replacement is granted:</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Items of personal use eg: Panchgavya soap.</li>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>
          If your returns match our delivery to your location, then we may pick it up. But this can take time
          as arranging separately for a return pickup is not cost-effective and so we normally pick up items
          when we are delivering to you or nearby locations.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may also mail your product to B/3, Prabhat Society, Ground floor, Dr. Mukherjee Road, Near CKP
